## Frontend

React + NEXT.js + Tailwind CSS

Run by navigating to `frontend/app` and running `npm run dev`. You'll need to do `npm install` the first time.

### Development Notes

I used `create-next-app` to generate the boiler plate. I choose to use Tailwind CSS during that process as well. The routing uses the `src/pages` folder as the entry point, and `index.js` is the default path - that's where you'll find the example page.
